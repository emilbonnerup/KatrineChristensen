            <h2 id="newinfromkanyewest">New in from Kanye West</h2>
            <p>Today I bought a new shirt designed by Kanye West. I saw the opportunity to buy the shirt when i was scrolling through my Instagram feed and saw a post by TeamKimye saying that the shirt now was for sale on shop.kanyewest.com. </p>

            <p>I immediately jumped the offer and ordered the shirt. Canâ€™t wait to try it on.</p>
